# Java Basics: Welcome Program

This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates the basics of Java programming by printing a welcome message to the console.

## Program Overview

The `Main` class includes a `main` method, which is the entry point for any Java application. This program uses the `System.out.println()` function to print the text "Welcome" to the console.

## Code

```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Welcome");
    }
}
