# Java Learning Journey ðŸš€

This repository documents my step-by-step progress in learning Java programming. Each topic is accompanied by examples and exercises for better understanding.

## Topics Covered So Far

### 1. **Variables and Data Types**
   - Learned how to declare and initialize variables in Java.
   - Explored different primitive data types:
     - `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`
     - `float`, `double`
     - `char`, `boolean`
   - Example: Printing various data types with meaningful values.

### 2. **Typecasting**
   - Understood how to convert one data type into another (casting).
   - Covered:
     - **Widening Casting**: `int` â†’ `double`
     - **Narrowing Casting**: `double` â†’ `int`
   - Example: Successfully converted an integer to a double and printed the value.

### 3. **Grade System Example**
   - Built a simple Java program to calculate and assign grades based on average marks.
   - Learned to:
     - Take input (mocked manually for now).
     - Perform arithmetic operations.
     - Use conditional statements (`if-else`).

## Example Programs

1. **Primitive Data Types**:
   - A program demonstrating the use of all primitive data types.

2. **Typecasting**:
   - A program showcasing typecasting between different data types.

3. **Grade System**:
   - A practical example that calculates grades based on student marks.

## Next Steps

- Learn **Control Statements** like `if`, `switch`, `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.
- Practice more examples and post them here.
